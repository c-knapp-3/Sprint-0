# Sprint-0
The src folder contains code for the LeastCommonMultiple program which finds the lcm using input from user which must be two positive integers. This folder also contains code for the simple GUI I implemented with the upcoming SOS game in mind.
The test folder contains JUnit testing for two of the methods in the LeastCommonMultiple program. It uses three different tests (assertEquals, assertTrue and assertFalse) to test different scenarios for accuracy.
The Report folder contains a completed report with "key decisions" entered, a screenshot of the LCM program running, a screenshot of the LCM TEST program running, and a screenshot of the GUI program running.
